# Project Info

A work in progress personal project that involves learning Unity for the first time with the help of a few YouTube videos and Google. 
The game being created is a mining simulator which is based off of a dated flash internet game called "Motherload".
I played the game when I was younger, and have now become more appreciative of the simple design and stylistic narrative, which I hope to replicate with my version.
The project was started in late November 2022 and continues to be worked on weekly in the hopes of finishing by late January.
